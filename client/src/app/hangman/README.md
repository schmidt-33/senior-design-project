# notes, errata, etc

## general

- styling! I did very little if anything here
- unused ids, classes, etc scrubbing
- if the original logic (player 1 chooses a word, player 2 guesses, switch) is wanted, that could be a separate game or game mode
- no real transitions exist at the moment
- some of those word lists are very obviously drafts
  - I fixed the one British English spelling we found and removed a forward slash, but they need to be reviewed and expanded
